# HelloðŸ‘‹
# Some words about me.
A few words about me. 
My name is Rezuan Dzibov I am 17 years old, and I live in a small town in Russia.
I have no hobbies like this because at this moment I am completely immersed in development. 
But I read books. 
Fan I think would be a bit of a mouthful, but I follow a kind of motorsport called Drift. 
# English
Right now I'm actively learning English and improving it every day. 
But at the moment it is somewhere at the level of A2-B1.
# Developing
Here we are getting close to development. 
I'm positioning myself as a backend developer, but I'm trying to go beyond just that branch of development. 
I am writing scrapers, bots and more, I mean I am trying many things since the Python language is full of features. 
My main development technology is Django framework. 
I already wrote a few web applications with Django and Django-Rest-Framework (training projects).
I am also familiar with Selenium and Scrapy frameworks. 
Some experience with Telegram bot development using Aiogram and SQLAlchemy ORM. 
I also know some basics of testing. PyTest, unittests and other testing tools. 
So far this is enough for me, but in near future (I hope) I will learn more about FastAPI and other technologies.
