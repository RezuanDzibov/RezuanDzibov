<h1>HelloðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h1>Some words about me.</h1>
<h4>
    A few words about me. 
    My name is Rezuan Dzibov. I live in a small town in Russia.
    I have no hobbies like this because at this moment I am completely immersed in development. 
    But I read books. 
    Fan I think would be a bit of a mouthful, but I follow a kind of motorsport called Drift.
</h4>
<h1>English</h1>
<h4>
    Right now I'm actively learning English and improving it every day. 
    But at the moment it is somewhere at the level of A2-B1.
</h4>
<h1>Developing</h1>
<h3>
    Here we are getting close to development. 
    I'm positioning myself as a backend developer, but I'm trying to go beyond just that branch of development. 
    I am writing scrapers, bots and more, I mean I am trying many things since the Python language is full of features. 
    My main development technology is Django framework. 
    I already wrote a few web applications with Django and Django-Rest-Framework (training projects).
    I am also familiar with Selenium and Scrapy frameworks. 
    Some experience with Telegram bot development using Aiogram. 
    I also know some basics of testing. PyTest, unittests and other testing tools. 
    So far this is enough for me, but in near future (I hope) I will learn more about FastAPI and other technologies.
</h3>
<h2>
    I want to warn you that I describe in this block technologies with which I am familiar. 
    With some as Django, Django-Rest-Framework I know close and with some as Scrapy, Selenium, SQLAlchemy, FastAPI I get acquainted at the moment and already have some knowledge in these technologies.
